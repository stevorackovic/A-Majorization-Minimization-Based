# A Majorization-Minimization Based Method for Nonconvex Inverse Rig Problems in Facial Animation


This reporsitory contains scripts used for the paper 'A Majorization-Minimization Based Method for Nonconvex Inverse Rig Problems in Facial Animation'.
Out of five head character models used trouought this research, three are publically available at https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/metahuman-creator . However, MetaHuman creator offers only base models without animation, hence here we give also the blendshape weights that can be added to the models to recreate our experiments.

The three characters used here are Omar, Danielle and Myles. In the folder Data one can find names of the blendshape controllers and the corresponding activation weights for each.
