# Accurate-Solution-of-the-Inverse-Rig-for-Realistic-and-Complex-Blendshape-Models


This reporsitory contains scripts used for the paper 'Accurate Solution of the Inverse Rig for Realistic and Complex Blendshape Models' (and the corresponding technical report).
Out of five head character models used trouought this research, three are publically available at https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/metahuman-creator . However, MetaHuman creator offers only base models without animation, hence here we give also the blendshape weights that can be added to the models to recreate our experiments.

The three characters used here are Omar, Danielle and Myles.
